,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,"12/2016 - Robert Kelly - Zafar is one of the least productive TAs I have ever encountered at Stony Brook. His performance and attitude was so poor I had to dismiss him just as the grading of the final exams was to have begun. He had very few TA responsibilitiesfor CSE 312 (essentially just quiz and exam grading), yet he could not even do that. He never came to class, never bothered to learn any material covered in the classes, rarely had any interaction with students, and was consistently unresponsive to requests. He started grading the CSE 312 midterm 4 days late, having just vanished on the wekkend that grading was to have begun. Oce he returned, his work was incredibly poor. I consistently reviewed sample exams, and on every exam he had grading errors. At that time, his performance was so poor that I had to remove him from any TA responsibilities for CSE 312 and have him focus just on the grading in ISE 218, a course that had more numerical and short answer questions. Even with the simpler responsibilities of ISE 218 grading, he made numerous errors. At the time of the ISE 218 final exam, he wrote me that he would not be able to grade the final exam until he had completed all his personal coursework and his work in the week is only limited to 20 hours, despite having no TA responsibilities for the previous three weeks. In addition to his poor attitude and lack of technical skills, I found his communications skills equally poor. He tended to avoid any conversation about his TA responsibilities and displayed an inability to read written English. This last item seemed odd since his spoken English was acceptable, yet he consistently appeared unable to understand simple paragraphs written by students in the exams.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,"06/2018 - Sergey Madaminov (CSE 320) - Excellent; Best TA Nomination; Held review sessions and I heard good reviews from students, helped to create exams and questions were well designed and thought being at the same of the appropriate level of difficulty. All grading/regrading requests were done in timely manner.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,"01/2019 - Eugene Stark (CSE 320) - Poor; Confidential: The only good things I have to say are (1) he is a pleasant person; (2) unlike the other TA in the case of the first midterm exam, he actually showed up after agreeing to help me administer the second midterm exam; and (3) he remained responsive to my emails between the final exam date of Dec 20 and when I finally got the grades in on Dec 27.  Beyond that, he wasn't of much help to me.  He (and the other TA) apparently managed to put in so little effort on a regular basis, and got so little useful accomplished when they did put in any effort, that I was unable throughout the semester to obtain reliable grading results from them in any kind of a timely fashion, and I ended up doing a lot of it myself.  He had been a TA for me for the same course in Fall 2017, and also wasn't very useful at that time, but I convinced myself that maybe it was because I had asked him to do something (primarily make up test questions) that he wasn't very good at.  This time, in his third semester as a TA for this course, I had higher hopes, but nothing came of it. ----------------- For the record, what follows is an extended account of what happened (or didn't happen) during the semester.  The basic theme is that both TAs (Chawla and Georgiev) apparently did not allocate sufficient and regular time to their TA responsibilities, and when they did allocate time they managed to get blocked by trivialities that wasted still more time, and finally were not competent at producing reliable results.  In the end, of five homework assignments I graded two of them (HW3 and HW5 entirely myself), I finally had to push through HW1 and HW2 to finish them up, and I ended up having to essentially re-grade HW4 in order to have confidence in the reliability of the results.  As the grading never got on schedule the entire semester, there was no chance for me to ask the TAs to help me in any other way, such as creating exam questions, which I had hoped to get them to do.  ------ I was initially assigned as TAs for CSE 320 Harpreet Singh Chawla and Xingzhi Guo.  I met with Chawla and Guo separately on 9/5, but then in the evening of 9/5 Guo was reassigned and I was assigned Georgi Georgiev instead.  Chawla, Georgiev, and I met on 9/10 to discuss responsibilities.  I explained that I wanted them to hold office hours, take care of the grading of the student programming assignments (including creating the test cases required for the grading), respond to student complaints about the grading, and hopefully also to be able to come up with a few multiple choice questions here and there.  I also explained that we wanted to automate the grading of most of the assignments by running test cases against student code on a server system, but that by its nature, HW4 would likely have a significant manual component to its grading, which they should be prepared to handle, roughly around Thanksgiving.  ----- HW1 was due on 9/21.  We had a meeting about it on 9/19.  By 10/8, after having sent a number of communications about it, there was still not a set of test cases that had been set up to be run against student submissions and vetted against a subset of them.  The first midterm exam was on 10/11, and since I hadn't yet managed to get HW1 grades, it hadn't seemed to make sense to distract the TAs by asking for help with the exam questions.  By 10/12 I was told that all the test cases had been completed and pushed to the development repository, but that they hadn't yet figured out how to use the setup on the grading server to run the tests.  I had given information on this and indicated a plan they should follow to familiarize themselves with it, but they hadn't done that.  I don't think it was unreasonable to expect PhD students to be able to do this type of thing without major hand-holding -- at the beginning of Spring 2018 I had to figure the whole thing out and set it up and I managed to do it.  When I looked at what they had done on the grading server, it was apparent that they hadn't followed the instructions I had given them about which setup from the Spring semester to start with.  Over the following days I got emails about trivialities that were preventing them from getting scores out.  By 10/15 I was getting concerned and spent the day working on it myself.  At that point I needed the TAs to push through some final details and make sure there weren't systematic errors.  I had to stay involved in this until I was finally able to push out the HW1 grades on 10/16, nearly a month after the assignment was originally due.  ----- I then pointed the TAs at HW2 which had already been due on 10/5 and also suggested that it was not too early to start making up test cases for HW3, which would be due on 10/26.  I asked for a status report on 10/23 and received a reply (from Georgiev, the other TA) saying that they were aiming to be done with HW2 ""by the end of the week"".  From looking at what was (not) happening on the grading system and in the development repository where the tests were being created, I could see that things were not really progressing as well as all that.  A few further emails were exchanged during 10/24 - 10/28.  On 11/5 I asked again for a status report.  This time Chawla sent the reply, saying ""We are ready with the test cases. Can you please take a look and let us know if they seem good?  If so we can start with the grading.""  On 11/12 Georgiev emailed me and said that they just hadn't been able to figure out how to use the setup on the grading server.  I then went and corrected the setup myself, and I noted that most of the tests they had created were broken.  By 11/13 I was again doing the test runs myself, as I had for HW1 and again I asked the TAs to look at the results and check for systematic errors (I pointed out some places where I thought there might be some).  By 11/18 I still did not find the HW2 test results to be reliable and I rewrote the tests myself, finding and correcting various issues.  Once again I had to push things through myself to get them done properly.  Midterm Exam 2 was held on 11/20, so once again as the grading was really behind I had not had any chance to get any TA help with making any test questions.  ----- As HW3 had many similarities to the Spring 2018 version and I felt that I could adapt the test setup used for that semester, I gave up on the idea of trying to get the TAs to grade HW3 and I did it myself.  On 11/19 (the Monday before Thanksgiving), we had a meeting to discuss what would be done with HW4, which potentially would involve a significant manual grading component (I had told them about this at the outset of the semester).  I came away from the meeting with the assurance that the TAs would develop a grading rubric and protocol during that week, and would then put in regular time so that they could crank through the evaluation of the submissions.  By 12/1 all I had gotten was an essentially blank spreadsheet with some column headings, supposedly for grading items, but without any indication of what they meant or what the protocol was going to be for evaluating these items.  When I complained, I got a reply from Georgiev with some further detail on the grading items.  I sent some comments about some things that I thought were missing.  On 12/3 I got an email from Chawla indicating that they were not able to compile the student codes on the grading system due to a library needing to be installed.  I wondered why this had not been noticed much earlier, but I immediately installed the library.  On 12/10 (the Monday after the end of classes) I sent another request for a status report.  Chawla replied: ""Me and Georgi were talking about the same thing yesterday, and we were planning to sit on this Wednesday to make more progress.  We have been caught up in a continuous barrage of homeworks and exams with a time gap of 3-4 days for the last 2-3 weeks.""  ----- On 12/12 I got an email from Georgiev asking questions about some of the things I had said previously (over a week before) about the tests they were planning.  He wanted to have a meeting, but at this point I had to work on making up final exams for 320 and for 306, and as I couldn't see the point in wasting more time in a meeting after which nothing was going to get done anyway, I told them I just wanted them to get something done.  On 12/14 I got an email from Georgiev announcing ""this is final version of the rubrics that we're going to use to grade students"".  I told them to ""proceed post-haste"".  On 12/20 I asked again for a status report and I got a reply from Chawla saying ""We have been able to go through 61 of them prior to morning"", and complaining about how the grading was taking time because of student codes that fork bombed or crashed their login sessions.  Georgiev emailed me asking me to shut down the ""apport"" (crash dump) service on the grading server, because it was slowing them down.  When I looked, I saw student code that had been in a runaway fork mode for two days.  I ended up rebooting the system, but wondered why it took them two days to notice this and let me know.  ----- After 12/20, Georgiev seemed to leave the picture and I received communications only from Chawla.  On 12/21, Chawla emailed me saying he was almost done with the grades.  I started spot-checking and found out that they had checked out the master branch from the student git repositories, rather than the version tagged ""hw4"", so a bunch of the grading had been done on the wrong version of the student code.  I identified the revisions that had been graded and calculated a list of students for whom the wrong version had been graded and the differences between the graded version and the version that should have been graded.  I sent that information to Chawla.  He responded on 12/22 with updated grades.  I was busy reading the 306 final exams, and I didn't get back on this until 12/24.  However, when I started to check the updated work, I found that one student's grade had been lowered from 21 to 6, but that there were no code changes between the two revisions in the repository.  After looking into it some more, it seems that the state of the system had not been properly reset before the testing run, which resulted in it appearing to be broken.  ----- At this point I did not have very much confidence in the results the TAs had produced, so I decided to write a set of tests of my own to try to get some kind of corroboration.  I spent about a day and a half on that and by 12/26 I was able to make a scatter plot that helped me identify significant discrepancies between my scores and theirs.  I found out that I was missing a grade for one student who should have been graded, and that there were several other discrepancies, which I decided to ameliorate by adding together the TA scores and my scores to get a final score.  Chawla at least did continue to respond to my emails through 12/26, but I heard nothing from Georgiev.",,,,,,,,

I had him in 540 the previous semester, so I know him to be a smart guy.   An illness mid-semester delayed some of the grading and left me wondering what was going to happen, but once he recovered he took responsibility for catching up on the missed work.  The grading in CSE 219 was supposed to be done by appointment with the students, but his illness threw a monkey wrench into this plan and a significant amount of the grading was done without the students present.  Catching up at the end of the semester also meant that some of the grading was rushed, which tended to lead to errors and lack of entropy in the scores.  I scored him as ""Very Good"" due to his diligence in the face of his illness, but I would also like to note that he tended to give the students more slack than he should have (or that I wanted him to do), which led to extra work due to having to re-visit assignments that the students resubmitted when they didn't work on the grading platform, and a lack of traceability of what version of the student's code was actually graded (I asked him to record the git commit ID on the grade sheets, but he didn't do this systematically).",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,"01/2019 - Eugene Stark (CSE 320) - Poor; Confidential: The only good thing I have to say is that is is a pleasant person. Aside from that he was useless to me this semester.  How useless was he?  My father had a colorful expression for this involving farm animals, but I will not use that here.  Suffice it to say that he (and the other TA) apparently managed to put in so little effort on a regular basis, and got so little useful accomplished when they did put in any effort, that I was unable throughout the semester to obtain reliable grading results from them in any kind of a timely fashion, and I ended up doing a lot of it myself.  Needless to say, I could not get any other help besides grading from him.  I asked him to choose 3 hours per week for office hours, and he chose 2.  He replied to my email asking for help in administering Midterm 1 and he said he could come, but then he did not show up.  In spite of his appearing to be knowledgeable about computer systems, and so on, he seemed to have little creativity, and was constantly stalled (after long periods of time during which nothing happened) by trivialities that I would expect a PhD candidate in Computer Science ought to be able to handle.  Finally, although I had an extended email exchange with the other TA (Chawla) during the period 12/21 - 12/26, which was copied to Georgiev, I heard nothing from Georgiev about any of it.  Then, suddenly, he responded to an email from C.R. Ramakrishnan, and copied his response to me, about grades for CSE 698.  ----------------- For the record, what follows is an extended account of what happened (or didn't happen) during the semester.  The basic theme is that both TAs (Chawla and Georgiev) apparently did not allocate sufficient and regular time to their TA responsibilities, and when they did allocate time they managed to get blocked by trivialities that wasted still more time, and finally were not competent at producing reliable results.  In the end, of five homework assignments I graded two of them (HW3 and HW5 entirely myself), I finally had to push through HW1 and HW2 to finish them up, and I ended up having to essentially re-grade HW4 in order to have confidence in the reliability of the results.  As the grading never got on schedule the entire semester, there was no chance for me to ask the TAs to help me in any other way, such as creating exam questions, which I had hoped to get them to do.  ----------------- I was initially assigned as TAs for CSE 320 Harpreet Singh Chawla and Xingzhi Guo.  I met with Chawla and Guo separately on 9/5, but then in the evening of 9/5 Guo was reassigned and I was assigned Georgi Georgiev instead.  Chawla, Georgiev, and I met on 9/10 to discuss responsibilities.  I explained that I wanted them to hold office hours, take care of the grading of the student programming assignments (including creating the test cases required for the grading), respond to student complaints about the grading, and hopefully also to be able to come up with a few multiple choice questions here and there.  I also explained that we wanted to automate the grading of most of the assignments by running test cases against student code on a server system, but that by its nature, HW4 would likely have a significant manual component to its grading, which they should be prepared to handle, roughly around Thanksgiving.  ----------------- HW1 was due on 9/21.  We had a meeting about it on 9/19.  By 10/8, after having sent a number of communications about it, there was still not a set of test cases that had been set up to be run against student submissions and vetted against a subset of them.  The first midterm exam was on 10/11, and since I hadn't yet managed to get HW1 grades, it hadn't seemed to make sense to distract the TAs by asking for help with the exam questions.  By 10/12 I was told that all the test cases had been completed and pushed to the development repository, but that they hadn't yet figured out how to use the setup on the grading server to run the tests.  I had given information on this and indicated a plan they should follow to familiarize themselves with it, but they hadn't done that.  I don't think it was unreasonable to expect PhD students to be able to do this type of thing without major hand-holding -- at the beginning of Spring 2018 I had to figure the whole thing out and set it up and I managed to do it.  When I looked at what they had done on the grading server, it was apparent that they hadn't followed the instructions I had given them about which setup from the Spring semester to start with.  Over the following days I got emails about trivialities that were preventing them from getting scores out.  By 10/15 I was getting concerned and spent the day working on it myself.  At that point I needed the TAs to push through some final details and make sure there weren't systematic errors.  I had to stay involved in this until I was finally able to push out the HW1 grades on 10/16, nearly a month after the assignment was originally due.  ----------------- I then pointed the TAs at HW2 which had already been due on 10/5 and also suggested that it was not too early to start making up test cases for HW3, which would be due on 10/26.  I asked for a status report on 10/23 and received a reply (from Georgiev, the other TA) saying that they were aiming to be done with HW2 ""by the end of the week"".  From looking at what was (not) happening on the grading system and in the development repository where the tests were being created, I could see that things were not really progressing as well as all that.  A few further emails were exchanged during 10/24 - 10/28.  On 11/5 I asked again for a status report.  This time Chawla sent the reply, saying ""We are ready with the test cases. Can you please take a look and let us know if they seem good?  If so we can start with the grading.""  On 11/12 Georgiev emailed me and said that they just hadn't been able to figure out how to use the setup on the grading server.  I then went and corrected the setup myself, and I noted that most of the tests they had created were broken.  By 11/13 I was again doing the test runs myself, as I had for HW1 and again I asked the TAs to look at the results and check for systematic errors (I pointed out some places where I thought there might be some).  By 11/18 I still did not find the HW2 test results to be reliable and I rewrote the tests myself, finding and correcting various issues.  Once again I had to push things through myself to get them done properly.  Midterm Exam 2 was held on 11/20, so once again as the grading was really behind I had not had any chance to get any TA help with making any test questions.  ----------------- As HW3 had many similarities to the Spring 2018 version and I felt that I could adapt the test setup used for that semester, I gave up on the idea of trying to get the TAs to grade HW3 and I did it myself.  On 11/19 (the Monday before Thanksgiving), we had a meeting to discuss what would be done with HW4, which potentially would involve a significant manual grading component (I had told them about this at the outset of the semester).  I came away from the meeting with the assurance that the TAs would develop a grading rubric and protocol during that week, and would then put in regular time so that they could crank through the evaluation of the submissions.  By 12/1 all I had gotten was an essentially blank spreadsheet with some column headings, supposedly for grading items, but without any indication of what they meant or what the protocol was going to be for evaluating these items.  When I complained, I got a reply from Georgiev with some further detail on the grading items.  I sent some comments about some things that I thought were missing.  On 12/3 I got an email from Chawla indicating that they were not able to compile the student codes on the grading system due to a library needing to be installed.  I wondered why this had not been noticed much earlier, but I immediately installed the library.  On 12/10 (the Monday after the end of classes) I sent another request for a status report.  Chawla replied: ""Me and Georgi were talking about the same thing yesterday, and we were planning to sit on this Wednesday to make more progress.  We have been caught up in a continuous barrage of homeworks and exams with a time gap of 3-4 days for the last 2-3 weeks.""  ----------------- On 12/12 I got an email from Georgiev asking questions about some of the things I had said previously (over a week before) about the tests they were planning.  He wanted to have a meeting, but at this point I had to work on making up final exams for 320 and for 306, and as I couldn't see the point in wasting more time in a meeting after which nothing was going to get done anyway, I told them I just wanted them to get something done.  On 12/14 I got an email from Georgiev announcing ""this is final version of the rubrics that we're going to use to grade students"".  I told them to ""proceed post-haste"".  On 12/20 I asked again for a status report and I got a reply from Chawla saying ""We have been able to go through 61 of them prior to morning"", and complaining about how the grading was taking time because of student codes that fork bombed or crashed their login sessions.  Georgiev emailed me asking me to shut down the ""apport"" (crash dump) service on the grading server, because it was slowing them down.  When I looked, I saw student code that had been in a runaway fork mode for two days.  I ended up rebooting the system, but wondered why it took them two days to notice this and let me know.  ----------------- After 12/20, Georgiev seemed to leave the picture and I received communications only from Chawla.  On 12/21, Chawla emailed me saying he was almost done with the grades.  I started spot-checking and found out that they had checked out the master branch from the student git repositories, rather than the version tagged ""hw4"", so a bunch of the grading had been done on the wrong version of the student code.  I identified the revisions that had been graded and calculated a list of students for whom the wrong version had been graded and the differences between the graded version and the version that should have been graded.  I sent that information to Chawla.  He responded on 12/22 with updated grades.  I was busy reading the 306 final exams, and I didn't get back on this until 12/24.  However, when I started to check the updated work, I found that one student's grade had been lowered from 21 to 6, but that there were no code changes between the two revisions in the repository.  After looking into it some more, it seems that the state of the system had not been properly reset before the testing run, which resulted in it appearing to be broken.  ----------------- At this point I did not have very much confidence in the results the TAs had produced, so I decided to write a set of tests of my own to try to get some kind of corroboration.  I spent about a day and a half on that and by 12/26 I was able to make a scatter plot that helped me identify significant discrepancies between my scores and theirs.  I found out that I was missing a grade for one student who should have been graded, and that there were several other discrepancies, which I decided to ameliorate by adding together the TA scores and my scores to get a final score.  Chawla at least did continue to respond to my emails through 12/26, but I heard nothing from Georgiev.  ",,,,,,,,

He is a bit behind here, but I DO NOT think these course grades are reflective of his ability.  This summer is the first in which he had no courses and has been able to focus on research.  The atmosphere of research suits him very well as opposed to test taking and coursework which are a bit more stringent.  While this evaluation may in part be a bit subjective (as opposed to grades), I give him my strongest support as a PhD researcher.  He has been my strongest PhD student in terms of both aptitude and work effort.  Personally, I believe he will have a very strong PhD thesis.  I strongly support his candidacy as he is showing to be an effective research (when given ability to focus on research compared to courses) and is moving towards his first major publication.

Classes:  He requires two more A's next semester for course qualification.  Progress:  In Bipul's first year, he only passed one course.  Since then, I have advised him on reduced course load to two courses.  This past semester,  he passed his two courses. The next semester he will be again taking two courses.  My assumption is that he will receive at least one A and ideally two such that he can focus just on research.  Combined with his RPE this spring, he should progress nicely toward a finished PhD baring any unforeseen circumstance. Concern:  Bipul might need an extra semester to pass a qualification course.

While working on research problems, he only cares about the final accuracy numbers of his experiments, without trying to understanding the underlying reasons. Last semester, we had to give up a CVPR conference paper submission 2 hours before the deadline because of his careless mistake.

I asked him to hold office hours, answer questions on Piazza, and grade the student programming projects.  He did all those things, promptly, thoroughly, and accurately.  He did not have to be goaded (or even reminded) that grading needed to get done -- he just did it, and he did it much the same way as I would have done it myself.  He was very knowledgeable about Operating Systems to start with, but he worked out the assignments himself so as to better understand how to help the students and do the grading.  Not only that, but to my surprise I found that he had left a trail of commits to the git repository that I set up at the beginning of the semester, which will likely be of use to me in designing projects in future semesters.  I didn't think I would need him at the final exam, so I didn't send him an email about it, but he sent me an offer to to help out without having been asked about it.

,,,,,,,,,"01/2019 - Jie Gao (AMS345/CSE355) - Good; Confidential: Xingfang started being a good TA. She helped with answering questions on piazza and took initiatives to help students. But towards the later half of the semester, her performance dropped. The homework grading assignment for her part was long delayed. Despite numerous email reminders and promises from her, very little progress was made on homework grading. Eventually I had to take over and finish grading homework myself. I wish not to have her as my TA anymore. ",,,,,,,,
